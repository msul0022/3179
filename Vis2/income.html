                The map below shows the <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>average weekly income</b></span> earned by each state in Australia. <br><br>
                There is a drop-down box you can use to select which year of data you wish to view. Selecting from this 
                will filter both the map and the chart to the right, the Cost of Living Indicators.
                <br><br> Clicking on a state in the map will filter the Cost of Living Indicators chart to highlight that state. 
                <br><br> From the map, we can see that Western Australia is consistently around the top for 
                <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>average weekly income</b></span>, whilst South Australia and Tasmania are among the lowest earners.
                <br><br> This Cost of Living Indicators chart shows whether a state earns <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>above</b></span> or 
                <span style="color: #CC2031"><b>below</b></span> the average weekly income. Arrows are sized based on how big the difference from average is. 
                <br><br> To see how far income goes, we look at what proportion of average weekly income is consumed by 
                <span style="color: #FFD200"><b>petrol</b></span>, assuming a tank is 50 litres.
                <br><br> From this, we can see that in 2023, Tasmanians workers are earning $157 <span style="color: #CC2031"><b>below</b></span> average, 
                and 7.9% of their weekly income would go towards filling their <span style="color: #FFD200"><b>petrol</b></span> tank. 
                <br><br> On the other hand, workers in the Australian Capital Territory earn $263 <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>above</b></span>
                average in 2023, with 5.9% of their income going towards <span style="color: #FFD200"><b>petrol</b></span>.

                <p>The graph on the left shows the average weekly salaries for 18 different industries in Australia. 
                    <br><br> The wages for each industry can be compared with the <span style="color: #B00180"><b>average weekly income</b></span>, represented by the vertical line.
                    <br><br> There is a drop-down box where you can change the year to view only the data for the selected year.
                    <br><br> Income for the mining industry is much greater than any other 
                    industry, earning almost $600 more than the next highest salary.</p>

            <div class="newspaper">
                From the line chart below, it can be seen that <span style="color: #1A3B8E"><b>males</b></span> in Australia 
                consistently earn more than <span style="color: #F08080"><b>females</b></span>, who earn 
                below <span style="color: #B00180"><b>average</b></span> in every year.
                <br><br> There is a clear trend with income <b>increasing</b> significantly over time. 
                <br><br> There is a slight dip in earnings from mid-2020 to the end
                <br> of 2020. This could potentially be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                <br><br><br> This chart shows whether earning are <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>above</b></span> or 
                <span style="color: #CC2031"><b>below</b></span> the average weekly income for different age groups.
                <br><br> In the drop-down box you can choose to view data for fulltime or parttime income. <br><br>
                It can be seen that, for both types of work, 15-19 year olds earn well below the average income. 
                <br><br> While those aged 65 and older earn <span style="color: #4BA962"><b>above</b></span> the average for fulltime work,
                parttime work is a different story with this same age group earn <span style="color: #CC2031"><b>below</b></span> average.
